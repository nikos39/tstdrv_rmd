The test drive continues...

```{r, eval=TRUE}
test <- c(1, 4, 6, 7, 12)
drive <- c()
for (i in 1:length(test)) {
  drive[i] <- paste0("The test drive no.", test[i], " ", "is magnificent!")
  print(drive[i])
}
```

We can make a function out of that loop!

```{r}
test_drive <- function(x) {
  paste0("The test drive no.", x, " ", "is magnificent!")
}
test_drive(test)
```

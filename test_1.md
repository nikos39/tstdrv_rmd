The test drive continuesâ€¦

``` r
test <- c(1, 4, 6, 7, 12)
drive <- c()
for (i in 1:length(test)) {
  drive[i] <- paste0("The test drive no.", test[i], " ", "is magnificent!")
  print(drive[i])
}
```

    ## [1] "The test drive no.1 is magnificent!"
    ## [1] "The test drive no.4 is magnificent!"
    ## [1] "The test drive no.6 is magnificent!"
    ## [1] "The test drive no.7 is magnificent!"
    ## [1] "The test drive no.12 is magnificent!"

We can make a function out of that loop!

``` r
test_drive <- function(x) {
  paste0("The test drive no.", x, " ", "is magnificent!")
}
test_drive(test)
```

    ## [1] "The test drive no.1 is magnificent!" 
    ## [2] "The test drive no.4 is magnificent!" 
    ## [3] "The test drive no.6 is magnificent!" 
    ## [4] "The test drive no.7 is magnificent!" 
    ## [5] "The test drive no.12 is magnificent!"
